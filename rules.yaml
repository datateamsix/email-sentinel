  weekend_mode: normal

# Configuration Tips:
#
# 1. Start Conservative
#    Add only the most critical keywords/senders initially.
#    You can always expand later based on your needs.
#
# 2. Test Your Rules
#    Use: email-sentinel test filter "Filter Name" "sender@example.com" "subject text"
#    This helps verify which emails will be marked as priority.
#
# 3. VIP Domains vs VIP Senders
#    - Use vip_domains for entire companies/organizations
#    - Use vip_senders for specific individuals
#
# 4. Keyword Strategy
#    - Be specific to avoid too many false positives
#    - Consider your industry (add technical terms, domain-specific keywords)
#
# 5. Quiet Hours
#    - Set these to avoid notifications during sleep
#    - Note: Urgent emails from VIP senders may still notify (future feature)

# Examples:
#
# Example 1: Mark all emails from your manager as urgent
# vip_senders:
#   - manager@company.com
#   - director@company.com
#
# Example 2: Mark all emails from a specific client domain as urgent
# vip_domains:
#   - importantclient.com
#   - megacorp.com
#
# Example 3: Add custom urgent keywords for your industry
# For DevOps/SRE:
# urgent_keywords:
#   - production down
#   - outage
#   - incident
#   - security alert
#   - deployment failed
#
# For Sales:
# urgent_keywords:
#   - contract
#   - deal closing
#   - proposal
#   - quote needed
#
# For Support:
